### Alternative install guide

Reference to [CremBluRay guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-asus-rog-gl552vw-laptop-macos-mojave.280413/)<br/>
Make sure your EFI partition size is greater or equal 200MB, else you can extend it, please Google how to do
1. Download the Clover folder from this [catalina](https://github.com/baobaoit/Asus-ROG-GL552VW-Hackintosh/tree/catalina) branch
2. Install MacOS Catalina according to [Olarila instructions](https://olarila.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=8685)
    - You may need to plug in a usb mouse to be able to progress through the setup
    - During the installation process, at the first reboot, you need to select Boot install from PreBoot
    - At the second boot, select Boot from X (the partition name you set to install)
3. Once finished with the setup, use clover configurator (Open the USB installer > open the FILES folder, you will see it and other tools there) to mount the EFI of the hard drive
4. In the EFI partition, you'll see a folder called EFI. (If you don't see this, make one and drag the folder labelled Apple into it as well). Open it and place the BOOT and CLOVER folders from the usb install drive into the folder (next to the folder labelled Apple). This will install clover onto the partition and you can now safely eject the usb install drive
5. Open terminal and type 'sudo trimforce disable' (this will make boot time much faster)
6. Done!
